# face-recognition attendance based System.

•	Developed an automated attendance system leveraging face recognition technology to record attendance in real-time.
•	Face Recognition: Utilized InsightFace (a deep learning-based face recognition library) for accurate identification of individuals from camera feeds.
•	Preprocessing: Applied OpenCV for image preprocessing, including face detection, alignment, and resizing, ensuring consistent recognition accuracy.
•	Attendance Management: Integrated NumPy and Pandas to manage attendance records, efficiently handling data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
•	Data Handling & Processing: Utilized SciPy for mathematical processing and optimized algorithms to ensure minimal processing time for large datasets.
•	Database: Redis
